Difference Between Views and User Defined Functions:

Views and User-Defined Functions almost serve the same purpose. 
But the major difference is that User-Defined Function can accept parameters, where as Views cannot. 
And also the output of the User Defined Function can be directly used in the SELECT clause, 
whereas you cannot do it with a View.

Views are nothing but saved SQL statements, and are sometimes referred as Virtual Tables. 
Keep in mind that Views cannot store data rather they only refer to data present in tables.
