When GROUP BY is not used, 
the WHERE and HAVING clauses are essentially equivalent.

However, when GROUP BY is used:

The WHERE clause is used to filter records from a result. 
The filtering occurs before any groupings are made.

The HAVING clause is used to filter values from a group 
(i.e., to check conditions after aggregation into groups has been performed).
